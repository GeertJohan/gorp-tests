This repo contains a very simple mock of how gorp works (dialect interface).

The goal here is to compare testing frameworks and approaches. Especially how to use context to run the same tests with different dialects.
Each folder in this repo contains a testing strategy, normally those `_test.go` files would reside in the main package.
